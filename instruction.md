Welcome to Firecrawl
Firecrawl is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean markdown for each. No sitemap required.

â€‹
How to use it?
We provide an easy to use API with our hosted version. You can find the playground and documentation here. You can also self host the backend if youâ€™d like.

Check out the following resources to get started:

 API: Documentation
 SDKs: Python, Node, Go, Rust

Crawl: scrapes all the URLs of a web page and return content in LLM-ready format
Map: input a website and get all the website urls - extremely fast
Extract: get structured data from single page, multiple pages or entire websites with AI.
â€‹
Powerful Capabilities
LLM-ready formats: markdown, structured data, screenshot, HTML, links, metadata
The hard stuff: proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic content (js-rendered), output parsing, orchestration
Customizability: exclude tags, crawl behind auth walls with custom headers, max crawl depth, etcâ€¦

Crawling
Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl.

â€‹
Installation

Python

Node

Go

Rust

Copy
pip install firecrawl-py
â€‹
Usage

Python

Node

Go

Rust

cURL

Copy
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Crawl a website:
crawl_status = app.crawl_url(
  'https://firecrawl.dev', 
  params={
    'limit': 100, 
    'scrapeOptions': {'formats': ['markdown', 'html']}
  },
  poll_interval=30
)
print(crawl_status)
If youâ€™re using cURL or async crawl functions on SDKs, this will return an ID where you can use to check the status of the crawl.


Copy
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "123-456-789",
  "url": "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl/123-456-789"
}
â€‹
Check Crawl Job
Used to check the status of a crawl job and get its result.


Python

Node

Go

Rust

cURL

Copy
crawl_status = app.check_crawl_status("<crawl_id>")
print(crawl_status)
â€‹
Response
The response will be different depending on the status of the crawl. For not completed or large responses exceeding 10MB, a next URL parameter is provided. You must request this URL to retrieve the next 10MB of data. If the next parameter is absent, it indicates the end of the crawl data.


Scraping

Completed

Copy
{
  "status": "scraping",
  "total": 36,

Scraping
To scrape a single URL, use the scrape_url method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.


Python

Node

Go

Rust

cURL

Copy
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Scrape a website:
scrape_result = app.scrape_url('firecrawl.dev', params={'formats': ['markdown', 'html']})
print(scrape_result)
â€‹
Response
SDKs will return the data object directly. cURL will return the payload exactly as shown below.


Copy
{
  "success": true,
  "data" : {
    "markdown": "Launch Week I is here! [See our Day 2 Release ðŸš€](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/launch-week-i-day-2-doubled-rate-limits)[ðŸ’¥ Get 2 months free...",
    "html": "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\" class=\"light\" style=\"color-scheme: light;\"><body class=\"__variable_36bd41 __variable_d7dc5d font-inter ...",
    "metadata": {
      "title": "Home - Firecrawl",
      "description": "Firecrawl crawls and converts any website into clean markdown.",
      "language": "en",
      "keywords": "Firecrawl,Markdown,Data,Mendable,Langchain",
      "robots": "follow, index",
      "ogTitle": "Firecrawl",
      "ogDescription": "Turn any website into LLM-ready data.",
      "ogUrl": "https://www.firecrawl.dev/",
      "ogImage": "https://www.firecrawl.dev/og.png?123",
      "ogLocaleAlternate": [],
      "ogSiteName": "Firecrawl",
      "sourceURL": "https://firecrawl.dev",
      "statusCode": 200
    }
  }
}

Extraction
With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:

v1 is only supported on node, python and cURL at this time.


Python

Node

cURL

Copy
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# Initialize the FirecrawlApp with your API key
app = FirecrawlApp(api_key='your_api_key')

class ExtractSchema(BaseModel):
    company_mission: str
    supports_sso: bool
    is_open_source: bool
    is_in_yc: bool

data = app.scrape_url('https://docs.firecrawl.dev/', {
    'formats': ['json'],
    'jsonOptions': {
        'schema': ExtractSchema.model_json_schema(),
    }
})
print(data["json"])
Output:

JSON

Copy
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "json": {
        "company_mission": "Train a secure AI on your technical resources that answers customer and employee questions so your team doesn't have to",
        "supports_sso": true,
        "is_open_source": false,
        "is_in_yc": true
      },
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Mendable",
        "description": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",
        "robots": "follow, index",
        "ogTitle": "Mendable",
        "ogDescription": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",
        "ogUrl": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/",
        "ogImage": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/mendable_new_og1.png",
        "ogLocaleAlternate": [],
        "ogSiteName": "Mendable",
        "sourceURL": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/"
      },
    }
}
â€‹
Extracting without schema (New)
You can now extract without a schema by just passing a prompt to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.


cURL

Copy
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/",
      "formats": ["json"],
      "jsonOptions": {
        "prompt": "Extract the company mission from the page."
      }
    }'
Output:

JSON

Copy
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "json": {
        "company_mission": "Train a secure AI on your technical resources that answers customer and employee questions so your team doesn't have to",
      },
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Mendable",
        "description": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",
        "robots": "follow, index",
        "ogTitle": "Mendable",
        "ogDescription": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",
        "ogUrl": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/",
        "ogImage": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/mendable_new_og1.png",
        "ogLocaleAlternate": [],
        "ogSiteName": "Mendable",
        "sourceURL": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/"
      },
    }
}
â€‹
Extraction (v0)

Python

JavaScript

Go

Rust

cURL

Copy

app = FirecrawlApp(version="v0")

class ArticleSchema(BaseModel):
    title: str
    points: int 
    by: str
    commentsURL: str

class TopArticlesSchema(BaseModel):
top: List[ArticleSchema] = Field(..., max_items=5, description="Top 5 stories")

data = app.scrape_url('https://news.ycombinator.com', {
'extractorOptions': {
'extractionSchema': TopArticlesSchema.model_json_schema(),
'mode': 'llm-extraction'
},
'pageOptions':{
'onlyMainContent': True
}
})
print(data["llm_extraction"])
â€‹
Interacting with the page with Actions
Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.

Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.

It is important to almost always use the wait action before/after executing other actions to give enough time for the page to load.

Example

Python

Node

cURL

Copy
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Scrape a website:
scrape_result = app.scrape_url('firecrawl.dev', 
    params={
        'formats': ['markdown', 'html'], 
        'actions': [
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "click", "selector": "textarea[title=\"Search\"]"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "write", "text": "firecrawl"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "press", "key": "ENTER"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},
            {"type": "click", "selector": "h3"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},
            {"type": "scrape"},
            {"type": "screenshot"}
        ]
